Rossmann stores predictions


</br>
This is the implementation of a Competition from Kaggle.
Rossmann is a store sales chain from Germany and the goal of this project is to predict the sales.
To do that, I have developed:
  1. EDA Process to understand the data
  2. Data Preprocessing to transform and prepare the data for the next phase
  3. Training with some ML models
  4. Validation and Evaluation with the suggested metric
  
  The information of the Competition is here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales
