    Function to change whether or not the data distribution of the test set is the same as the distribution of the
    training set. To do so, we will run a random forest model that will try to predict if a data point belongs to the
    training set or to the test set. If the model is too confident at discriminating the two sets, the sales prediction
    model needs to be retrained.
